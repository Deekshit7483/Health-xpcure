            <p>Last updated: November 23rd, 2024 | Version 1.0</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Content Section -->
        <div class="terms-content">
            <p>At XPCURE, we do not collect any personal information from users when they simply use our app. However, if we detect any suspicious activity or
                inconsistencies in user behavior, we reserve the right to conduct additional verification checks. This may include verifying the identity of both 
                patients and nurses to ensure the safety and trustworthiness of the platform.</p>

                <p>In the event that false or misleading information is discovered during these checks, XPCURE retains the right to take necessary actions, including
                    suspending or terminating the account. Our primary objective is to maintain the integrity of the platform, protecting all users from potential risks 
                    while providing a reliable and secure service for both patients and nurses.</p>

                    <p>This policy outlines the process for verifying user identities and credentials and the consequences of providing false information.</p>

            <h2>1. Patient Verification</h2>
            <p>
                To ensure the security and privacy of both patients and nurses, all patients are required to provide valid identification for account creation. Accepted forms of ID include:
                <li>Aadhaar Card</li>
                <li>PAN Card</li>
                <li>Passport</li>
                <li>Voter ID</li>
                <li>Other government-issued IDs</li>
                
                This verification is mandatory to protect both parties and ensure that only verified individuals use our platform for medical care. Failure to provide valid documentation may
                result in account suspension or denial of service.</p>

            <h2>2. Nurse Verification</h2>
            <p>
                All nurses registering on the XPCURE platform must provide the following valid documents:
                <li>Government-issued ID (Aadhaar, PAN, Passport, etc.)</li>
                <li>Professional Certifications and Medical Qualifications</li>
                <li>Work Experience Documents (if applicable)</li>
                
                These documents are thoroughly reviewed to ensure that only qualified and certified nurses are onboarded. This process safeguards patients and maintains the high standards
                of care XPCURE is committed to providing.</p>

            <h2>3. Consequences of False Information</h2>
            <p>
                Submitting false or fraudulent documents during the verification process is strictly prohibited and may lead to severe consequences, including:
<li>Immediate Account Suspension or Termination: Users found to have submitted false documents will have their accounts permanently deactivated.</li>
<li>Legal Action: XPCURE reserves the right to pursue legal action against individuals who submit fraudulent information, including reporting to law enforcement or relevant
     authorities.</li>
            </p>

            <h2>4. Data Privacy and Security</h2>
            <p>
                All documents and personal information provided during the verification process are protected under our Privacy Policy. We use advanced encryption and security measures to 
ensure that all data is stored securely and is only accessible to authorized personnel for the purpose of verification. This information is never shared with third parties without 
user consent and is used solely to confirm identities and credentials.</p>

            <h2>5. Ongoing Verification</h2>
            <p>XPCURE may conduct periodic reviews of user accounts to ensure that all information remains up to date and accurate. Users may be asked to re-verify their identity or submit
                updated documents in case of expiration or changes in their status</p>

            <h2>
                6. Compliance with Legal Requirements</h2>
            <p>XPCURE complies with all relevant legal and regulatory requirements concerning identity verification and data handling. This ensures that our platform maintains its integrity 
                and operates within the framework of the law.
                
                <br><br>By adhering to this Verification Policy, XPCURE ensures a safe, trustworthy environment for both patients and nurses. Any breach of these terms will be dealt with promptly and
                in accordance with legal standards.</p>
